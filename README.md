Usage

This app is a simple demonstration of how to create a parallax effect using Reanimated and Expo Sensors. The app consists of a single screen with a background image that moves as the phone is rotated.

The app uses the Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors to track the phone's rotation and movement, and then applies that data to the image using Reanimated.
